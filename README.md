# pokedex


Pokedex is a project with the intention of interacting with the Pokeapi. This project developed the capabilities to learn about working with an API. Additonally the project is fun allowing you to explore the Pokemon world, catch a pokemon, inspect a pokemon and list your inventory of them all within a console application.

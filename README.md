# pokedex


Pokedex is a project with the intention of interacting with the Pokeapi. This project developed the capabilities to learn about working with an API. Additonally the project is fun allowing you to explore the Pokemon world, catch a pokemon, inspect a pokemon and list your inventory of them all within a console application.

See HELP in the app for available commands, which some include:
- map: List of 20 map locations within the Pokemon world.
- mapb: List the previous 20 map locations to move backwards in the list from map.
- explore <location>: List the available pokemon that can be caught in the area.
- catch <pokemon>: Catch the named pokemon to be stored within your Pokedex.
- pokedex: List your already caught pokemon.
- inspect <pokemon>: See the stats related to your pokemon that you've already caught (hp, attack, etc.).
